## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recentl, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `cstecgi.cgi` binary:

In `setUrlFilterRules` function, `url` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow,so we can control the `url` to crash the server.

The input has not been checked.And then,call the function nvram_set to store this input.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/1.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

In `rc` binary:

Eventually, the initial input will be extracted and cause the stack overflow.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/2.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

As you can see here,The length of the input array(v3) is only 256 bytes, we can tamper with the content of the `url` field, such as a very long string.After that, it will cause the function return address to be overwritten.

**Supplement**
This vulnerability not only crashed my router, but also cannot be repaired, it can only be restored through rescue mode.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part. 



## PoC

We set `url` as **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....** , and the router will crash, such as:

```http

```

## Result

The target router crashes and cannot provide services correctly and persistently.
