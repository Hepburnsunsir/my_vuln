## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `httpd` binary:

In `guestWifiRuleRefresh` function, `qosGuestUpstream、qosGuestDownstream` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow, so we can control the `qosGuestUpstream、qosGuestDownstream` to crash the server.

There is a judgment logic in the function `refreshMibItem`, and one of the two inputs needs to be limited to a value of 0 to enter the vulnerability trigger point.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/1.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

The function call chain:`formQOSSet`->`guestWifiRuleRefresh`

In `formQOSSet` function, Only when the value of flag is 1, the `guestWifiRuleRefresh ` function will be called.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/2.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

In `setQosPolicy` function, Only when the value of `qosPolicy` is the string "user", will the flag value be 1.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/3.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part. 



## PoC

We set `qosGuestDownstream` as **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....** , and the router will crash, such as:

```http
POST /goform/setQos HTTP/1.1

```



## Result

The target router crashes and cannot provide services correctly and persistently.
