## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `httpd` binary:

In `formSetStaticRoute` function, `staticRouteNet、staticRouteMask、staticRouteGateway` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow,so we can control the `staticRouteNet、staticRouteMask、staticRouteGateway` to crash the server.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/1.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

As you can see here, the input has not been checked. The parameter `staticRouteNet、staticRouteMask、staticRouteGateway` is directly copy to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing buffer overflow.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part. 



## PoC

We set `staticRouteNet` as **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....** , and the router will crash, such as:

```http
POST /goform/setStaticRoute HTTP/1.1

```



## Result

The target router crashes and cannot provide services correctly and persistently.
