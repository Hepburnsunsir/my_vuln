## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recentl, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `cstecgi.cgi` binary:

In `setL2tpServerCfg` function, `eip縲《ip縲《erver` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow,so we can control the `eip縲《ip縲《erver` to crash the server.

As you can see here, the input has not been checked.And then,call the function nvram_set to store this input.

In `rc` binary:

Eventually, the initial input will be extracted and cause the stack overflow.

**Supplement**

This vulnerability not only crashed my router, but also cannot be repaired, it can only be restored through rescue mode.

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part. For example, make sure it is a valid ip address.



## PoC

We set `eip` as **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....** , and the router will crash, such as:
