## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability  in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recently，allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack overflow**

In `setNoticeCfg` function,`IpTo` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack call,so we can control the `IpTo` to crash the server.

**Supplement**

Initially, I discovered this vulnerability on A720R, which is located in `cstecgi.cgi`. Interestingly, during the process of observing other devices, I found that this function was encapsulated in `system.so`, such as A3100R; finally, I completed the verification on the A3100R device.

## PoC

We set `IpFrom` as aaaaaaaaaaaaa... , and the web server will crash,such as:
