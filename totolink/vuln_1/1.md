## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recently，allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `setNoticeCfg` function,`IpFrom` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `IpFrom` to attack the OS.

**Supplement**

Initially, I discovered this vulnerability on A720R, which is located in `cstecgi.cgi`. Interestingly, during the process of observing other devices, I found that this function was encapsulated in `system.so`, such as A3100R; finally, I completed the verification on the A3100R device.



## PoC

We set `IpFrom` as **;bin/telnetd;** , and the router will excute it,such as:

```http
