## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in TOTOLINK Technology router with firmware which was released recentl, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Leakage of sensitive information**

The router does not default-ly use HTTPS for logging into its admin interface. This fact means that communication between it and the user during administrative tasks are not encrypted.

The design flaw can be seen by capturing the packets from your web browser to your router using something like Burp.

Many products will be affected, we suggest that encrypt the user name and password and then transmit them.
